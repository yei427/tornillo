 program to calculate the values of various screws
- conical screws
- helical screws
- STRAIGHT TOOTH SPIRAL GEAR

- alfa version
  
- STRAIGHT TOOTH SPIRAL GEAR
- The module and the number of teeth are given; with this information, the primitive diameter, the outer diameter, and the tooth height are calculated

- helical screws
-  The requested data includes the actual module, the number of teeth, and the inclination angle. With this information, the primitive diameter, outer diameter,
  tooth height, apparent module, helix pitch, and the imaginary number of teeth are calculated.

- conical screws
"The requested data includes:
- Gear module
- Number of gear teeth
- Tooth length
- Angle at the center of the gear

Calculated and provided are:
- Major primitive diameter
- Major outer diameter
- Major inner diameter
- Tooth length
- Generatrix length on the primitive cone
- Angle corresponding to the module
- Angle corresponding to the bottom of the tooth play
- Inclination angle of the cutter
- Semi-angle of the outer cone
- Tooth height at the outer diameter
- Minor outer diameter."


Alpha version capable of performing basic operations. Still in testing, it avoids the presence of different letters or factors. Version 0.1.
